## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
This project is an implementation that matches with all the code challenge requirements that were sent in previous contact.

### General

#### Design
For this test I choose to make the application design simple without the full DDD architectural context and this design is illustrated in the image below:

![img.png](docfiles/application-design.png)

To avoid letting to much code operations in the controller and in the job class itself I added a service layer to centralize those interactions.

> Disclaimer: In real projects I would prefer to not let the images used for documenting something in the project itself.

#### Global Exception Handler and Controller response pattern for BAD REQUESTS
The Global Exception Handler is meant to define a pattern for HTTP bad responses, such as `BAD REQUEST`, `INTERNAL SERVER ERROR` and so on.

1. Default response format for bad requests
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-01-17T17:37:39.663376",
  "argumentsErrors": [
    {
      "field": "ttl",
      "message": "When informed, TTL value must be a greater than ZERO!"
    }
  ],
  "detail": "uri=/cache"
}
```

2. Generic response for unhandled exceptions
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-01-17T17:43:17.470364",
  "message": "An unexpected error happened. Please contact support",
  "detail": "uri=/cache"
}
```
> When an unhandled exception happens the Exception handler just log the exception message and it's stack trace but in true applications it could do something more to let the development team know about the problem that happened. 

### Stack Challenge
For the challenge I decided to implement a custom stack class (`com.tmg.codingchallenge.cachechallenge.data.CustomStack`), but in real applications I would rather use
  `java.utils.Stack` if it's suitable for the application needs.
> The package `com.tmg.codingchallenge.stackchallenge` contains the classes for this part of the test.

### In-memory key-value storage with TTL Challenge

For the matters of this test, I decided to implement an active expiring storage, but in real applications I would take
into consideration the usage it's intended for the feature in order to decide for an active or passive approach, and I would also prioritize using a existent tool if it matches the applications needs.

#### Active Expiration System
The active expiration system were made using a `@Scheduled` method located on `com.tmg.codingchallenge.cachechallenge.presentation.job.CacheExpirationJob` that runs every second and calls a Service Class that remove every item that is expired from the in-memory key-value store.
> Disclaimer: In real applications I would use some third-party software based structure as Spring Cache with Redis, so the usage of a Scheduled method was just for this challenge in particular. Another thing that is worth mentioning is that `@Scheduled` is not safe for multi-instance environment so if I need to develop something and the only option is to use `@Scheduled` structures I will take into consideration using it along with [ShedLock](https://www.springcloud.io/post/2022-07/shedlock/#gsc.tab=0) or replace it with a Cluster Mode [Quartz](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.0.M3/reference/html/boot-features-quartz.html) setup.

#### Cache Data Structure

When developing the key-value in-memory store (that I have labeled as "cache" on this project) I have created in the repository layer (`com.tmg.codingchallenge.cachechallenge.data.CacheRepository`) two HashMaps, the first one working as the real key-value store and the second one to store the expiration data.

I decided to use HashMap mainly because in most uses that are made in this project it helps to avoid iterating lists and to make sure there is only one register per key or per expiration time.

**Here is a quick explanation about how each operation works:**
1. Pushing Data: Once the data is validated, it removes any Entry in both HashMaps that can be related to the key pushed, then it creates a new Entry on the `cacheMap`. If the request have TTL, it creates/update the entry related with the expiration time to insert the cache that needs to be expired at that time.
2. Getting Data: Once the key is defined as valid by the Controller, it gets the value from the repository or return empty. (Obs: There is no passive expiring validation in this process)
3. Deleting Data: Once the key is defined as valid by the Controller, the respective entry is removed from the `cacheMap` and then it removes any expiring register in the other map if it exists. 
4. Once the job runs, it gets the actual time and use this to get every entry in the `expirationMap` that expired before or in that exact second, then these entries are removed from the `expirationMap` and the respective cache entries are removed from the other HashMap.

> Obs: I create a class `CacheEntry` that contains all the data for each cache, not just the value and there are 3 main reasons to do that:
> 1. Since it's the same object that is saved on both HashMaps, there is only one Object in-memory for each Cache.
> 2. It doesn't matter if you get the expiration map's entries or the actual cache map's entries you will always be able to track where is the respective Entry in the other map.
> 3. When expiring a cache entry, since I have the exact same object in the expiration map, it will only be removed from the cache map if it still the same object. This way if some problem occurs and a new cache value is written without removing the old expiring Entry, the new cache value will not be removed.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Before running this application in a local environment, make sure you have both [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed on your machine.

### Running

1. First download this project manually or clone it locally using Git and access the project's directory on your device.

```
git clone https://github.com/matheusaugsschmitz/PYYNE-TMG-Challenge.git
cd .\PYYNE-TMG-Challenge\
```

2. Then compile the project using the following Maven command

```
mvn install -DskipTests
```
> `-DskipTests` is used for avoid running automated tests after building the project, if you want to run the tests as well just remove this part from the command and execute it

3. And start the Spring Boot application
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

- Option 1: Run after Maven Install command
```
mvn test
```

- Option 2: Running along with Maven Install command
```
mvn install
```

### Break down into end-to-end tests
The end-to-end tests are meant to call the REST controllers and validate in the respective repositories if the data was added/modified as it was supposed to.

The end-to-end tests are located on the package `com.tmg.codingchallenge.endtoendtest` in the test directory.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Once you get the application running you can send requests to the REST controllers using Postman, Insomnia or any other tool that allows you to make HTTP requests.

This application have a Swagger page configured with the endpoints documentation that allows you to use them via web browser as well.
